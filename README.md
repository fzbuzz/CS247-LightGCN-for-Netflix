# CS247-LightGCN-for-Netflix
This project is done for CS247-Advanced Data Mining CourseWork at UCLA. The LightGCN model is experimented on three existing datasets and we build an Adaptive LightGCN model to use on Gowalla, Amazon-Book and Yelp2018. Furthermore, the LightGCN and Adaptive Light GCN model was also tested on Netflix dataset. Netflix dataset available was an explicit feedback form which required pre-processing techniques as well.
